  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>My name is Dorothea Gray and I’m a cat behaviorist. I have worked with cats since 2000 when I adopted my first cat, Sunshine. She had PSTD because her pre-owner abused her for a long time. She bite me for many times when I tried to pet her, so I got to hospital because of my injuries. My friends said that I should take her to the VET to sleep but I decided in a different way. I’ve read all books in this theme and I’ve done a cat behaviour training, shortly after a VET assistant training and finally a breeder training. Now I’m learning for an animal beautician.</p>
